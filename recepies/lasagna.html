                <ul>
                    <li>9 lasagna noodles</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
                    <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
                    <li>2 onion, diced</li>
                    <li>1 can crushed tomatoes</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon Italian seasoning</li>
                    <li>3 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella, divided</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup freshly grated parmesan</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly oil a 9×13 baking dish or coat with nonstick spray.</li>
                    <li>In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook lasagna noodles according to package instructions.</li>
                    <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add ground beef and onion and cook until beef has browned, about 3-5 minutes, making sure to crumble the beef as it cooks; season with salt and pepper, to taste. Drain excess fat. Stir in tomatoes and Italian seasoning until well combined.</li>
                    <li>In a medium bowl, combine ricotta, 1/2 cup mozzarella and egg; set aside.</li>
                    <li>Spread 1 cup tomato mixture onto the bottom of a 9×13 baking dish; top with 3 lasagna noodles, 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture and 1 cup mozzarella cheese. Repeat with a second layer. Top with remaining noodles, tomato mixture, 1 cup mozzarella cheese and Parmesan.</li>
                    <li>Place into oven and bake for 35-45 minutes, or until bubbling. Then broil for 2-3 minutes, or until top is browned in spots.</li>
                    <li>Let cool 15 minutes. Serve, garnished with parsley, if desired.</li>
                </ol>
